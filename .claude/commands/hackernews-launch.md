- Privacy and security focus

## Your Task

### 1. Show HN Post Variations (5 Options)

#### Option A: The Technical Story
**Title:** Show HN: Untrace â€“ Test webhooks locally without the hassle

**Body:**
Hey HN! I'm [name], and I've been frustrated with webhook development for years. Every time I needed to test a Stripe webhook locally, I'd spend 30 minutes setting up ngrok, dealing with SSL certs, or SSH tunneling to a VPS.

I built Untrace to solve this. It's a webhook proxy that:
- Sets up in under a minute with `npx untrace-cli`
- Gives you a permanent URL like `https://untrace.sh/wh_abc123`
- Routes webhooks to your local machine based on simple rules
- Lets your whole team share webhook URLs (huge for us)
- Provides E2E encryption so your data stays private

The killer feature for us has been team collaboration. Multiple devs can share the same webhook URL and route to different local environments based on headers or paths. No more "can you turn off your webhook so I can test?"

Tech stack: Node.js, WebSockets for real-time streaming, React for the dashboard. We use Cloudflare Workers for the edge routing.

Currently supporting Stripe, GitHub, Clerk, and any generic webhooks. Working on Shopify and Twilio next.

Would love your feedback, especially on:
1. Security concerns with webhook proxying
2. Features you'd want for your workflow
3. Pricing thoughts (currently free, planning teams tier)

Thanks for checking it out!

#### Option B: The Problem-First Approach
**Title:** Show HN: I was tired of webhook debugging taking hours, so I built this

**Body:**
Last month I lost an entire day debugging a Stripe webhook issue that turned out to be a timestamp mismatch. The problem? I was testing in production because local webhook testing is such a pain.

Built Untrace to fix this. It's basically ngrok but designed specifically for webhook development:

- Permanent URLs (no more URL changes breaking your testing)
- Team sharing (multiple devs, same webhook URL, different routing)
- Request replay (found a bug? Replay the exact webhook)
- Built-in request inspection (see headers, body, everything)

Example: `npx untrace-cli start --port 3000`
Gives you: `https://untrace.sh/wh_abc123`

Your team can use the same URL. Routes to whoever's actively developing.

Open to feedback on the approach. Not open source yet but considering it for the CLI.

#### Option C: The Comparison Angle
**Title:** Show HN: Untrace - Like ngrok but built for webhook development

**Body:**
I love ngrok, but it wasn't built for webhook development. After years of webhook pain, I built something specifically for this use case.

Key differences:
- Permanent URLs that don't change
- Team collaboration built-in
- Webhook-specific features (replay, modification, routing rules)
- E2E encryption by default
- No installation needed (`npx untrace-cli`)

Not trying to replace ngrok for general tunneling. This is laser-focused on making webhook development not suck.

Curious what the HN crowd thinks about specialized vs general tools. Is there value in building for a specific use case?

#### Option D: The Open Source Angle
**Title:** Show HN: Open-sourcing our webhook testing tool after 6 months internal use

**Body:**
We've been using Untrace internally for 6 months and it's transformed our webhook development. Decided to open source the CLI and offer a hosted version.

What it does:
- Routes webhooks to local dev environments
- Handles team collaboration (biggest win for us)
- Provides security via E2E encryption
- Works with major providers out of the box

GitHub: [link]
Hosted version: https://untrace.sh

The hosted version is free for individuals, planning a teams tier. Self-hosting is always free.

Would appreciate feedback on the architecture and security model especially.

#### Option E: The Technical Deep Dive
**Title:** Show HN: Built a webhook proxy using Cloudflare Workers and WebSockets

**Body:**
Interesting technical challenge: How do you build a webhook proxy that's fast, secure, and handles team collaboration?

Our approach with Untrace:
1. Cloudflare Workers for edge routing (sub-50ms latency)
2. WebSockets for real-time streaming to local envs
3. E2E encryption using libsodium
4. Route rules engine for team collaboration

The trickiest part was handling connection reliability. Webhooks can't retry forever, so we implemented a queue system with automatic failover.

Performance: 50ms overhead, 99.9% uptime so far
Security: E2E encrypted, no webhook storage
Scale: Currently handling 1M webhooks/day
