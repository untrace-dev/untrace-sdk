‚úÖ E2E Encryption: Your data stays private
‚úÖ Provider Support: Stripe, GitHub, Clerk, and more

üéØ Perfect For:

- Anyone who's ever shouted at ngrok

üí° Key Features:
‚Ä¢ Instant local webhook testing

Hey Hunters! üëã

I'm [Name], maker of Untrace. After losing countless hours to webhook debugging, I knew there had to be a better way.

The "aha" moment came when three developers on our team were all trying to test the same Stripe webhook. The current tools just weren't built for how modern teams actually work.

Untrace solves this with:
üéØ Permanent URLs (no more breaking integrations!)
üë• Team sharing (multiple devs, one webhook URL)
üöÄ 60-second setup (seriously, try it)
üîí E2E encryption (your data stays yours)

We're offering 50% off for Product Hunt users today only with code PHUNT50.

I'm here all day to answer questions. What's your biggest webhook debugging pain point?

Let's make webhook testing suck less, together! üí™
