# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# LLM Trace Forwarding Service - "Untrace"

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** January 2025
**Status:** Draft
**Author:** Product Team

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Untrace is a middleware service that acts as the "Segment.io for LLM observability," enabling developers to capture, route, and manage LLM trace data across multiple observability platforms with a single integration.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
The LLM observability market is fragmented with 10+ competing platforms (LangSmith, Langfuse, Keywords.ai, etc.). Development teams face several challenges:
- **Integration overhead**: Each platform requires separate SDK integration and maintenance
- **Vendor lock-in**: Switching platforms requires code changes and data migration
- **Data silos**: Trace data is scattered across multiple platforms
- **Cost inefficiency**: Duplicate data storage and processing across platforms
- **Limited flexibility**: Cannot easily route different traces to different platforms based on rules

### 1.3 Solution Overview
Untrace provides a unified ingestion layer that:
- Captures LLM traces through OpenAI-compatible proxy or native SDKs
- Routes traces to multiple destinations based on configurable rules
- Transforms data formats between different platform requirements
- Provides centralized monitoring and analytics
- Enables A/B testing across observability platforms

## 2. Market Analysis

### 2.1 Target Market Size
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: $2.5B (LLM observability market by 2027)
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: $500M (middleware/routing services)
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: $50M (5% market share in 3 years)

### 2.2 Competitive Landscape

#### Direct Competitors
- **None identified**: No direct "Segment for LLM traces" exists currently

#### Indirect Competitors
1. **LLM Observability Platforms** (that could add routing features)
   - LangSmith, Langfuse, Keywords.ai, Helicone
   - Risk: They could add multi-destination support

2. **General Observability Routers**
   - Vector, Fluentd, Logstash
   - Gap: Not optimized for LLM trace formats

3. **DIY Solutions**
   - Custom implementations by large enterprises
   - Our advantage: Managed service, pre-built integrations

### 2.3 Market Trends
- 87% YoY growth in LLM application development
- Average enterprise uses 3.2 different LLM observability tools
- 67% of teams cite "observability tool sprawl" as a pain point
- Increasing focus on cost optimization and trace sampling
