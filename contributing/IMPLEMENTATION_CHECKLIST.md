## üìù Implementation Notes

### Priority Order
1. Start with core infrastructure and API
2. Implement OpenAI proxy for quick wins
3. Add 1-2 destination integrations
4. Build minimal dashboard
5. Polish and document

### Key Decisions Needed
- [ ] Choose between Kafka vs Kinesis
- [ ] Select ORM (Prisma vs Drizzle)
- [ ] Decide on authentication provider
- [ ] Choose monitoring stack
- [ ] Select deployment platform

### Testing Strategy
- Use test-driven development where possible
- Mock external services for unit tests
- Create integration test environment
- Load test early and often

### Success Criteria for MVP
- ‚úÖ Can proxy OpenAI calls with <50ms overhead
- ‚úÖ Successfully routes to 3+ destinations
- ‚úÖ Handles 1000 traces/second
- ‚úÖ 99.9% delivery success rate
- ‚úÖ Basic dashboard functional
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete

**Remember**: Focus on getting a working MVP first, then iterate. Each checkbox should result in working, tested code that moves us closer to launch.
