## ðŸŽ¯ Project Summary

**Product Name**: Untrace

**Vision**: Build a middleware service that acts as "Segment.io for LLM observability" - enabling developers to capture LLM traces once and route them to multiple observability platforms.

**Core Value Props**:
1. Single integration, multiple destinations
2. Intelligent routing based on rules
3. No vendor lock-in
4. Cost optimization through sampling
5. Privacy-first with PII detection

**Target Market**:
- Primary: 50-500 employee SaaS companies using multiple LLM observability tools
- TAM: $2.5B by 2027
- SOM: $50M (5% market share in 3 years)

**MVP Timeline**: 3 months to launch with:
- OpenAI proxy
- 3 destination integrations
- Basic routing rules
- Simple dashboard
- Core SDKs (Python, TypeScript)

**Key Technical Decisions Needed**:
- Message queue: Kafka vs Kinesis
- ORM: Prisma vs Drizzle
- Backend language: Go vs Node.js/TypeScript
- Deployment: AWS vs GCP

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Review all documents with the team
2. Make key technical decisions
3. Start with Phase 1 implementation using the checklist
4. Set up development environment
5. Begin building the MVP

All documents are designed to be handed off to a cursor agent or development team for immediate implementation. The project is ready to move from planning to execution phase.
